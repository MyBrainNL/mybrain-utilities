== Description ==

This plugin is a collection of various utilities, used by My Brain for different websites.
We released this to the Wordpress Plugin repository as we think it is also useful to others.

= HTAccess_Keeper =
Checks, backs up and restores your .htaccess and wp-config.php files.
Makes a backup when files are modified and restores when a 0 bytes file has been detected. An e-mail will be sent to the Administration Email Address, whenever a damaged file has been restored.
Originally developed because some plugins keep (re)writing to these two files and sometimes leave them damaged as empty file. That broke the complete website, but /index.php was still being executed, allowing this plugin to restore the damaged file.

= Keep_me_logged_in =
Stay logged in longer. WordPress will keep you logged in for 48 hours. If you've clicked the "Remember Me" checkbox at login, you get remembered for 14 days.
This option keeps your login active longer than the standard Wordpress Login Cookie time-out. You may need to login again after you change the time-out value.

= Console_Warning =
This plugin adds a warning in the browser console log to any visitor, to only continue if they understand the code and trust the source.
Disable this option at your own risk.

= Openstreetmap/Leaflet Shortcode =
Adds a simple OpenStreetMap/Leaflet Shortcode to be used in your content/contact-page.
Inludes a standard marker and optional information popup.
